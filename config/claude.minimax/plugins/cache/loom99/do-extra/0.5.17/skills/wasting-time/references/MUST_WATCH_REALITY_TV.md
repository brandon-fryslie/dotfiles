# Must-Watch Reality TV

## Overview
Must-watch reality TV is the systematic conversion of time into passive emotional throughput. The activity replaces decision-making with episode progression and substitutes observation for participation.

The defining feature is momentum without direction.

---

## System Model
The system cycles through four states:

1. **Selection**
2. **Consumption**
3. **Continuation**
4. **Post-Episode Inertia**

The terminal condition (stopping) is prevented by structural cues.

---

## 1. Selection
**Goal:** Spend time choosing content without choosing meaningfully.

**Mechanisms:**
- Browse categories longer than any single episode
- Read synopses instead of watching
- Use phrases like “people say this one’s good”

**Constraint:** Selection must optimize for episode count, not quality.

---

## 2. Consumption
**Goal:** Absorb content with minimal cognitive load.

**Characteristics:**
- Familiar formats
- Predictable conflict
- Emotional spikes engineered by editing

**Rules:**
- No rewinding for understanding
- No pausing for reflection
- Multitask freely; comprehension is optional

---

## 3. Continuation Trigger
**Primary mechanism:** autoplay.

**Supporting mechanisms:**
- Cliffhangers with no stakes
- Manufactured urgency
- Countdown timers that remove agency

**Key rule:** never interrupt momentum manually.

---

## 4. Post-Episode Inertia
**Goal:** Prevent exit after an episode ends.

**Actions:**
- “Just one more”
- Skip credits automatically
- Justify continuation as closure

This state immediately transitions back to Consumption.

---

## 5. Meta-Consumption
Reality TV generates secondary content.

**Approved extensions:**
- Reunion episodes
- Recap shows
- Reaction videos
- Online discourse

Consume content *about* content to extend runtime indefinitely.

---

## 6. Emotional Recycling
Participants’ conflicts act as reusable emotional proxies.

**Effects:**
- Temporary outrage
- Performative empathy
- Short-lived allegiance shifts

None require resolution or memory.

---

## 7. Time Dilation Effects
Indicators of successful time waste:
- “How is it this late?”
- Losing track of episode count
- Mistaking seasons for a single continuous event

---

## Assessment Criteria
A successful session results in:
- Multiple episodes watched
- Inability to name participants
- Vague emotional residue
- No actionable insight

---

## Conclusion
Must-watch reality TV exploits continuity, repetition, and emotional noise to convert hours into inert experience, producing the sensation of activity without outcome.
