# Watching Paint Dry 101

## Overview
Watching paint dry is the disciplined transformation of waiting into an activity. The objective is not to observe change, but to remain present for change that does not meaningfully occur.

This document formalizes the process.

---

## System Model
The activity operates in a single dominant state with self-induced subcycles.

**Primary state:** Observation  
**Secondary states:** Rechecking, Verifying, Narrating

No terminal condition exists until external interruption.

---

## 1. Environment Selection
**Goal:** Maximize perceived responsibility for the drying process.

**Criteria:**
- Large, flat surface
- Neutral color
- Indoor lighting that exaggerates glare

Avoid fans or airflow; these introduce real progress.

---

## 2. Initial Observation
**Actions:**
- Stand close
- Identify “wet zones”
- Note brush stroke topology

**Constraint:** Do not touch yet. Touching resolves uncertainty too early.

---

## 3. Recheck Loop
This is the core time sink.

**Loop sequence:**
1. Step back
2. Wait 30–90 seconds
3. Lean in again
4. Compare against memory (unreliable)
5. Conclude “maybe slightly drier”

Repeat indefinitely.

---

## 4. Tactile Verification
**Trigger:** impatience masquerading as diligence.

**Method:**
- Light fingertip contact
- Immediate withdrawal
- Evaluate stickiness vs expectation

**Outcome:** inconclusive. This forces a return to Observation.

---

## 5. Micro-Theorizing
Invent explanatory models to justify continued attention.

Examples:
- “Edges dry faster”
- “This section looks different”
- “Lighting might be changing”

None are testable in practice.

---

## 6. Social Extension
Optional but effective.

**Techniques:**
- Call someone over to look
- Ask “does this look dry to you?”
- Disagree politely

Consensus is never reached.

---

## 7. False Completion Checks
Momentarily believe the paint is dry.

**Actions:**
- Prepare to move on
- Second-guess
- Check again “just to be safe”

This resets the loop.

---

## Assessment Criteria
Successful completion of Watching Paint Dry 101 results in:
- Significant elapsed time
- No measurable insight
- Persistent uncertainty
- Eventual realization that it dried long ago

---

## Conclusion
Watching paint dry converts passive delay into active vigilance, consuming time through repeated verification of a process that proceeds independently of observation.
