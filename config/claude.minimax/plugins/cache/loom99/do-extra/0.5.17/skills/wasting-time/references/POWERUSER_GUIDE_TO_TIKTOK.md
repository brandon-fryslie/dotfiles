# Poweruser Guide to TikTok

## Introduction
This guide treats TikTok as a controllable system, not entertainment. The feed is the output of a fast feedback loop driven by your inputs. Time spent is the cost; attention is the control variable.

## 1. How the Feed Actually Moves
TikTok updates your recommendation state continuously.

**Primary signals:**
- Watch duration (absolute and %)
- Replays
- Likes
- Shares
- Comments
- Follows
- Skip latency (how fast you swipe)

**Key rule:**  
Full watch > replay > like > comment > share > follow.  
Early skip strongly negates everything else.

Every swipe updates your profile vector. There is no “neutral” interaction.

## 2. Feed Reset and Rebuild
**Goal:** reduce entropy, then constrain it.

**Reset:**
- New account or cleared interests
- One session of aggressive skipping (sub-1s per video)
- Do not like anything

**Rebuild:**
- Pick 2–3 domains max
- Watch to completion
- Like selectively (≈50%)
- Never comment yet

Stability appears after ~200–300 interactions.

## 3. Precision Steering
To *nudge* without committing:
- Watch fully
- Do not like
- Do not follow

To *commit*:
- Watch + replay
- Like
- Follow

To *remove* content:
- Immediate skip (<0.5s)
- Repeat across similar videos

Do not rely on “Not Interested.” It is weaker than behavior.

## 4. Multi-Account Strategy
Each account is an independent model.

- Account A: exploration / novelty
- Account B: focused topic
- Account C: experiments or trash

Never cross-like, share, or comment between accounts. Timing correlation alone can leak signals.

---

## 5. Creator-Side Optimization
If posting:

- First 1–2 seconds determine distribution
- Flat openings die
- Mid-sentence cuts increase replays
- Replying to comments boosts reach more than new posts
- Reusing trending audio anchors you to an existing cluster

Treat each post as a probe. Adjust one variable at a time.

---

## 6. Exploiting Momentum
- First 60 minutes matter most
- Early engagement triggers re-fanning
- Small coordinated bursts outperform slow organic growth
- Mixed hashtags (high + obscure) outperform either alone

Momentum is multiplicative, not additive.

---

## 7. Defensive Use (Not Getting Trapped)
TikTok optimizes for variable reward.

Hard constraints:
- Fixed session timer
- No “just checking”
- Reset feed when drift exceeds tolerance

If you fight the algorithm, you lose. If you starve it, it resets.

---

## 8. Practical Uses
- Cultural reconnaissance
- Meme lifecycle tracking
- Format extraction for other platforms
- Rapid audience testing

Ignore content. Study structure.

## Conclusion
TikTok is a feedback-controlled system.  
Your behavior is training data.  
Your feed is the model output.
