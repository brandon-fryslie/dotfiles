description: Do nothing. Just vibes.
---

Print a single short, whimsical one-liner about doing nothing. Be creative and varied. Examples of the vibe (don't repeat these exactly):
- "Sitting around waiting for the mail..."
- "Watching paint dry, professionally."
- "Contemplating the void. It's nice."

Just output the line directly. No tools, no actions, no preamble. Keep it under 10 words.
