Run the `date` command to get the current time, then present it in a creative, unique way. **Always include the exact hours, minutes, and seconds** in your response. Be playful - maybe reference the time of day, make a quip about what hour it is, or add some personality. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences max). Different every time.
