# Address PR Review Findings

Read every pending review finding on the PR, **post your plan on each thread first**, then implement, push (which re-runs the reviewer), confirm-and-resolve the threads you fixed, and dismiss the reviewer's now-stale change request. Repeat until clean. Same model people use at a real company: handle reviewer findings AND human-reviewer threads in one pass, push back with reasoning when you disagree, resolve, dismiss, re-review.

[LAW:one-source-of-truth] `provider.fetch` is the single source of pending findings for this loop — every open finding on the PR, keyed by `thread_id` (when available). There is no second stream.

**Provider** — the active review backend is loaded from `provider.json` in the skill directory (or `PR_REVIEW_PROVIDER` env var). The provider contract is in `PROVIDER_CONTRACT.md`. To switch providers, change `provider.json`; the loop below does not change.

```python
# Load the provider once at the start of the loop
import provider_loader
provider = provider_loader.get()  # reads provider.json, validates CAPABILITIES
# or pin one explicitly for this session: provider_loader.get("adversarial")
```

## Setup — derive PR_URL, OWNER, REPO, PR_NUM once

If the user didn't give you a PR number, infer it:

```bash
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url --jq .url)
read -r OWNER REPO PR_NUM < <(echo "$PR_URL" | sed -E 's#.*github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+).*#\1 \2 \3#')
```

All subsequent commands use `$OWNER`, `$REPO`, `$PR_NUM`, and `$PR_URL`.

## Preflight — uptake the reviewer, then confirm it's installed

**This is the first thing the skill does** (after deriving the repo vars above), before the loop. When `provider.CAPABILITIES["setup_check"]` is `True`, run **one** `setup_check`; the `installed` boolean it returns is the single discriminator for both arms below.

```python
check = provider.setup_check(OWNER, REPO)
if not check["installed"]:
    raise SystemExit(f"Reviewer not installed: {check['message']}")
```

[LAW:no-silent-failure] a missing reviewer is the one failure that would otherwise look like "clean review, zero findings." Surface it as a hard stop, never an empty pass.

**Installed → uptake the latest reviewer into this repo before reviewing with it.** A repo set up against an older version still carries a stale workflow (old action ref, old secret name). Re-running the `agent-code-review-setup` skill re-applies the current ref and provider secret. [LAW:single-enforcer] address-pr-reviews never writes the workflow or sets the secret itself — it re-invokes the one skill that owns that install, so "what installed looks like" has exactly one definition.

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/agent-code-review-setup/install.sh
```

Idempotent: overwrites `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` to the current action ref and re-sets the provider secret from the keychain. It does **not** commit — if it changed the workflow file, commit that change so the repo actually uptakes the update; it rides along with this PR. [LAW:no-silent-failure] install.sh fails loudly on any missing precondition (keychain item, `gh` auth, GitHub remote); a failed uptake halts here rather than reviewing with a half-updated reviewer.

[LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] the rerun happens **iff** `installed` — one `setup_check`, one value, two arms: not-installed halts, installed uptakes-then-proceeds. There is no second detector and no second `setup_check` call. When `setup_check` capability is `False` (a non-workflow provider — `local`, `adversarial`), the whole section is skipped: no workflow to install means nothing to uptake.

## The loop

Each round runs in phases: **plan every finding, then implement, then confirm-and-resolve, then dismiss the stale change request.** Repeat the round until **step 2 returns zero unresolved findings**.

[LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling] the round has one owner of *when* resolution happens, split by a single fact per finding — does addressing it require a code change? A no-change finding (invalid, already-fixed) resolves the moment you decide it, because its resolution depends on nothing future. A change-needed finding resolves only **after the push that makes the fix real** — resolving it earlier would mark an unfixed thread "done," a lie about the code (`[FRAMING:representation]`). So the plan phase captures the change-needed set and the confirm phase drains it; the loop's empty `fetch` (step 2) is the net that re-surfaces anything dropped.

### 1. Trigger (if required) and wait for the review to finish

If `provider.CAPABILITIES["trigger"]` is `True`, request a review explicitly:

```python
provider.trigger(PR_URL)
```

Then wait for the review to complete (all providers, always):

```python
result = provider.wait(PR_URL)
```

Blocks until the review for the PR's **current head SHA** reaches `completed`, then returns `{status, conclusion, sha, url}`. If the head SHA's review is already complete (nothing new pushed), it returns at once.

[LAW:no-silent-failure] if `conclusion` is anything other than `success`, the reviewer itself errored — its findings are absent, not empty. Stop and surface the run `url`; do not treat a failed run as a clean review.

### 2. Fetch findings, and capture the change requests to dismiss

```python
data = provider.fetch(PR_URL)

# Capture the blocking reviews to dismiss at round end (step 8).
pending_reviews = []
if provider.CAPABILITIES["dismiss_review"]:
    pending_reviews = provider.change_requests(PR_URL)["reviews"]
```

`fetch` returns canonical JSON: every open finding on the PR keyed by `thread_id` (nullable for providers without GitHub threads). One shape per finding.

`change_requests` returns the automated reviewer's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews — `[{"review_id", "author", "commit_id"}]` — captured **now, before any push**, so step 8 dismisses exactly the reviews this round addressed and never the fresh re-review your push triggers. [LAW:one-source-of-truth] the dismiss set is what you read here, not what is blocking after you mutate the PR. It is scoped to Bot authors: a human's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is theirs to clear, never auto-dismissed. [LAW:no-silent-failure]

Schema:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.py",
      "line_start": 42,
      "line_end": 42,
      "body": "This silently swallows the error — surface it instead.",
      "author": "github-actions",
      "thread_id": "PRRT_xyz...",
      "is_resolved": false,
      "thread_comments": [
        {"author": "github-actions", "body": "This silently swallows the error — surface it instead."},
        {"author": "alice", "body": "agreed, fix incoming"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Unresolved findings** = every entry where `is_resolved` is false. `thread_id` is non-null when the provider declares `resolve: True`. If the unresolved list is empty, **the loop is done** — step 1 already guaranteed the run completed, so empty is unambiguous. Proceed to **Finalize** below.

[LAW:verifiable-goals] this empty `fetch` is the **only** thing that establishes done. Never infer doneness from "I pushed my fixes" or "I addressed everything" — re-run `fetch` and read zero unresolved. A fixed-but-unresolved finding still counts as unresolved here, which is the safety net: it re-surfaces as `already_fixed`, and you resolve it now rather than leaving it open forever.

> **Read `thread_comments` before deciding.** A finding may already contain replies (yours from a prior iteration, a human's pushback on the reviewer, or a back-and-forth). The full chain is in `thread_comments`; `body` is just the first comment for quick scanning.

> **`line_start` may be `null`** for a file-level (non-line-anchored) comment. Open the file and read the `body`/`thread_comments` for context; the finding still resolves by `thread_id` like any other.

### 3. Plan phase — triage every finding, resolve the no-change ones

For **each** unresolved finding, before writing any code: open the file at `file:line_start`, read `body` and the full `thread_comments` chain, and classify. Classification is the same regardless of `author`:

- **valid** — reviewer is right; a fix is coming
- **different_fix** — reviewer identified a real issue but proposed the wrong fix; a better fix is coming
- **invalid** — reviewer is wrong, or the suggestion violates an architectural law (defensive null guards, silent fallbacks, mode explosion, duplicate enforcement, control-flow in place of data-flow variance, etc.). Push back and **cite the law** (`[LAW:no-defensive-null-guards]`)
- **already_fixed** — resolved by a later commit; nothing to change

**Post a comment on the thread stating your plan for this finding** — what you'll do and why. This comment goes on every finding, valid or not; it is the durable record of the decision.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!,$body:String!){
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{pullRequestReviewThreadId:$id,body:$body}){ comment{id} } }
' -F id="$THREAD_ID" -F body="Plan: ..."
```

The classification carries **one discriminator: does addressing this finding require a code change this round?**

- **No change (invalid, already_fixed)** — the plan comment *is* the resolution. State why (cite the law for `invalid`), then **resolve the thread now**:

  ```python
  provider.resolve(THREAD_ID)
  ```

- **Change needed (valid, different_fix)** — post the plan comment and **leave the thread unresolved**. It resolves in step 7, after the fix is real. Add its `thread_id` to your change-needed set.

[LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] resolve-now vs. resolve-later is a value the classification carries, not a side branch — the same plan step runs for every finding; the discriminator picks when resolution happens. [LAW:single-enforcer] resolve only ever goes through `provider.resolve`, never a raw mutation — it's the one path that confirms GitHub accepted the resolution, so a resolve that didn't take can't pass as done.

When `provider.CAPABILITIES["resolve"]` is `False`, findings have no resolvable thread — note each finding's disposition in a reply if the provider supports it. The loop still converges when `fetch` returns zero open findings.

### 4. Implement the planned changes

Make the code changes for every finding in the change-needed set. Nothing here for a round whose findings were all no-change — the set is empty and this step does nothing.

### 5. Address failing checks

Check the PR for any failing checks. Address them before continuing.

### 6. Commit and push your fixes

Commit messages describe the **why** (architectural concern), not "address review comment" — each commit must stand alone in `git log`. Batch related concerns; separate unrelated.

Pushing triggers re-review for providers that auto-fire on push (`trigger: False`). If a round made no code change — only no-change resolutions — the head SHA is unchanged, its run is already complete, and step 1 returns immediately next round; the loop converges via step 2's empty list. For providers that require explicit triggering (`trigger: True`), the `trigger` call in step 1 handles re-running the reviewer. The rare case of forcing a re-run without a new commit for workflow-based providers is `gh run rerun <run-id>`.

### 7. Confirm phase — resolve every change-needed finding

The fix now exists in a pushed commit. For **each** finding in the change-needed set: post a comment on its thread describing the fix (reference the commit), then resolve it.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!,$body:String!){
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{pullRequestReviewThreadId:$id,body:$body}){ comment{id} } }
' -F id="$THREAD_ID" -F body="Fixed in <sha>: ..."
```

```python
provider.resolve(THREAD_ID)
```

[LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling] this phase is gated on the push, not deferred past it: you confirm-and-resolve the captured set here, in this round, before step 8. The empty `fetch` in the next round's step 2 is the safety net — a change-needed thread left unresolved re-surfaces and is handled again, never silently dropped.

### 8. Dismiss the stale change request

When `provider.CAPABILITIES["dismiss_review"]` is `True`, dismiss each review captured in step 2 — the now-addressed `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews — with a message explaining the resolution:

```python
msg = (f"All findings from this review are addressed (fixes pushed and threads "
       f"resolved) or responded to on their threads. Dismissing the stale "
       f"change request; re-review runs on the new commit.")
for r in pending_reviews:
    provider.dismiss_review(PR_URL, r["review_id"], msg)
```

[LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] the dismiss runs unconditionally when the capability is present; an empty `pending_reviews` dismisses nothing — there is no "if a review exists" branch. [LAW:single-enforcer] dismissal goes through `provider.dismiss_review`, which verifies GitHub recorded the `DISMISSED` state — an unconfirmed dismissal raises rather than passing as done. [LAW:no-silent-failure]

When `dismiss_review` is `False`, the provider posts no blocking review (it comments rather than requesting changes) — this step is a no-op the capability flag carries, exactly as `resolve` is.

**Round postcondition:** every thread from this round is resolved, and the change request the reviewer raised is dismissed. That is the end state for a single review round.

### 9. Go to step 1.

## Finalize — when the loop exits clean

The loop exits with zero unresolved findings after a clean re-review. The PR is reviewed; the work is done. [LAW:single-enforcer] this skill is the single place that closes a PR loop — merge, ticket-close, and recap live here, not scattered across callers or punted to the user. [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] finalize runs unconditionally on every clean exit; the data (the PR, the in-progress ticket, the merged commits) is what each step operates on. Per `<ticket-lifecycle>`, the agent owns ticket close-out — Finalize is where that happens. The recap step is the durable handoff to the next agent (its own justification, not something `<ticket-lifecycle>` requires).

[LAW:one-source-of-truth] **follow the tooling's runtime guidance.** Each step's tool (`gh pr merge`, `lit done`, `/recap`) emits its own instructions at runtime — preview tokens, next-step hints, branch-protection messages, admin-bypass prompts, apply-token strings, output paths. The skill describes the *shape* of each step; the tool itself is the authoritative source for *how* to follow through. Read what the tool prints and do what it says — don't paper over a warning, don't guess past a prompt, don't substitute the skill's wording when the tool gave you a literal token or path to use.

### A. Merge the PR

```bash
gh pr merge "$PR_URL" --squash --delete-branch
```

Squash is the repo's configured merge strategy. `--delete-branch` cleans up the remote branch (and the local one if checked out). [LAW:one-source-of-truth] `gh pr merge`'s exit code is the canonical signal of merge success — failure (required checks not satisfied, merge conflict, branch protection) halts Finalize. Don't add a `gh pr view --json merged` check as a second source; the exit code is the truth. At that point the agent's job changes from "close out" to "fix the merge blocker."

### B. Close the lit ticket

```bash
lit done "$TICKET_ID"
```

The ticket is the one this PR closed — pull it from the PR body, branch name, or the ticket you were working on in this session, and assign it to `$TICKET_ID`. The code block above is the canonical case: a confidently identified `$TICKET_ID`. Don't run `lit done` with an empty, guessed, or unverified value. `lit done` is a two-phase transition: the first call prints a preview with an apply token; capture it as `$TOKEN` and rerun with `--apply="$TOKEN"` to commit. For an out-of-band PR with no associated lit ticket, Step B is a no-op — skip the command entirely and note the missing-ticket case in the recap so the next agent sees it.

### C. Recap the merged work

Invoke `/recap` with a short note describing what was merged. The recap is the durable historical record — what shipped, what's left, what to watch out for. It lives in the project's recap log; future sessions browsing history read it there.

### D. Record the next instruction and run the close-out

The close-out runs `finalize-session` — the mandatory final step that records what shipped and the next instruction to pick up. It has two outcomes: run finalize-session (with content shaped by the candidate's classified state) or halt and surface a per-candidate failure table to the user. [LAW:types-are-the-program] the section's output is `Handoff = Finalize(direct_work) | Finalize(define_task) | HaltAndExplain(failure_table)` — variants of one typed value, dispatched mechanically from the classification step. Well-definedness is *not* a run/skip gate; it shapes the handoff content. The only halt case is project-level misalignment across every examined candidate.

**These three arms are exhaustive — no "skip," "hold," or "ask instead" arm exists.** The user being present or the step feeling minor are NOT inputs to this decision. Deviating requires citing a clause *in this skill*; a tool's tone or purpose is never authorization (`finalize-session` "requires no user action" means exactly that — run it without asking, not "only run it when the user is absent"). Absent such a clause the prescribed arm **executes as written** — never a silent skip, never a fallback to asking.

**Step 1 — Enumerate candidates.** Read multiple candidates in priority order:

1. An explicit instruction the user gave during this session for what comes next.
2. A concrete follow-up this PR surfaced and you queued as a ticket.
3. The top entries of `lit ready` — pull at least the top three with `lit show <id>` (or all of them if fewer exist).

A pool is needed because the highest-priority slot may hold work that no longer fits where the project actually is after this PR's epic shipped. The next-best aligned candidate is what to actually pick up next.

**Step 2 — Classify each candidate.** Each candidate sits in exactly one state:

- **AlignedAndDefined** — aligned with the project's current trajectory AND the work could be started without asking the user clarifying questions (acceptance criteria explicit, scope bounded, dependencies met).
- **AlignedButFuzzy** — aligned with the project's current trajectory BUT exploratory or probe-shaped ("explore X", "consider Y", "investigate Z"); the body of work is to *define* the actual work, not to start it.
- **Misaligned** — the candidate's premise no longer matches the project's actual requirements. Common after an epic ships: the queued item assumed an older architecture, depends on a hypothesis the recent work invalidated, expands surface area the user has decided to contract, or opens a strategic thread the user has not validated at the project level.

**What "aligned" means here — project-level, not session-level.** It asks: does this candidate continue the trajectory the project is actually on right now? After an epic ships, work queued before it may need rescoping, re-prioritization, or outright deletion to fit the project's new shape. That's a strategy call the agent cannot make for the user — when no candidate is aligned, the user must intervene before any handoff is meaningful.

**Step 3 — Dispatch.** Take the highest-priority candidate classified as Aligned (Defined or Fuzzy). Its state shapes the handoff content:

- **AlignedAndDefined** → hand off the direct work. The next instruction is a precise pointer (ticket ID, acceptance criteria, or `/next` when the candidate is the top of `lit ready`).
- **AlignedButFuzzy** → hand off a define-task: (1) understand the problem the candidate raises, (2) investigate possible solutions, and (3) prepare a proposal for the user that surfaces the important information quickly without burying them in irrelevant detail. Implementation waits on user approval of direction.

Empty aligned-pool (every examined candidate classified Misaligned, or no candidates exist at all) → **HaltAndExplain**. Do not run finalize-session. Surface to the user, in this turn, a per-candidate failure table — the candidate's title/ID and the precise reason it failed (what shipped, what direction the project moved, what the candidate assumed that no longer holds). Vague summaries are unacceptable; the user needs the specifics to rescope, reorder, or close the tickets.

**Step 4 — Run finalize-session** (AlignedAndDefined and AlignedButFuzzy arms):

```bash
~/.claude/skills/message-in-a-bottle/bin/finalize-session "$(cat <<'EOF'
Last session shipped PR #<num> — <one-line description of what merged>.
<forward-looking notes the next agent should know: in-flight context,
follow-ups this PR surfaced, things to watch out for>

<next instruction — for AlignedAndDefined: a precise pointer (ticket ID,
acceptance criteria) or /next. For AlignedButFuzzy: "Understand the
problem in <ticket>, investigate possible solutions, and prepare a
proposal for the user that surfaces the important information quickly
without burying them in irrelevant detail. Return with the proposal —
do not implement until the user approves direction.">
EOF
)"
```

[LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow] the variability lives in the candidates' classified state, not in whether the agent decided to look or run. Handoff content (direct vs define-task) and the halt-vs-run decision are both mechanical consequences of classification — the data picks the variant. Well-definedness in particular is a content discriminator, not a run/skip gate.

[LAW:one-source-of-truth] when finalize-session runs, its content derives from the same authored recap as step C — past-tense canonical form vs forward-looking action, one substrate consumed for two purposes. The finalize-session script's tmux precondition fails loudly outside tmux — the handoff is meaningless there.

Then stop. The loop is finished, the work is shipped, the recap is filed.

## Rules

- **You own the close-out.** When the loop exits clean, run Finalize (merge, close lit ticket, recap). Don't punt these to the user — `<ticket-lifecycle>` is explicit that the agent closes its own tickets, and a PR that sits open waiting for a human to push the merge button is the same anti-pattern. The finalize-session handoff (step D) runs whenever an aligned candidate exists in the pool; its content (direct work vs define-task) is shaped by whether the candidate is well-defined. The only halt case is project-level misalignment across every examined candidate — alignment is a strategy question the agent cannot answer on the user's behalf, and that case is surfaced as a per-candidate failure table for the user to act on.
- **Architectural laws override reviewer authority.** Refuse suggestions that violate `[LAW:...]`. Cite the law in the pushback reply on the thread — that text is the durable record of why the code is the way it is.
- **Plan on every thread before you touch code.** Each finding gets a plan comment in the plan phase — pushback-with-law for the ones you reject, the intended fix for the ones you accept. The comment is the durable record of the decision; the reviewer doesn't reply, so your comment is the only one.
- **Resolve every finding you addressed, including pushbacks — through `provider.resolve(thread_id)`, and only on confirmation.** No-change findings resolve in the plan phase; change-needed findings resolve in the confirm phase, after the fix is pushed — never before, because resolving an unfixed thread lies about the code. Open findings accumulate forever; resolution is the step that gets silently dropped, which is why it runs through the provider's verified path, not a raw mutation.
- **Dismiss the reviewer's stale change request once its findings are handled.** Through `provider.dismiss_review`, scoped to the captured Bot change-requests, with a message explaining the resolution. A human's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is never auto-dismissed — that one is theirs to clear. The round's end state is zero unresolved threads and no stale change request blocking the PR.
- **Conflicts between findings** — surface to the user before acting. Don't pick a side silently.
