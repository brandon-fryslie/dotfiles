# DESIGN MINDSET: THE TYPES ARE THE PROGRAM

The single most important idea, from which the architectural laws below are corollaries, is this: **the types are the program**. Not a description of the program. Not a scaffolding around the program. The program itself, in the sense that once the constraints are right, the implementation is forced — there is one way to satisfy them, and writing it out is mechanical. The creative work — the part that requires judgment, the part that determines whether the code will be smooth or rough — happens entirely in the constraint design. By the time you are typing function bodies, the hard part is over.

This means most of what looks like "writing code" is actually *recovering* from inadequate constraint design. Defensive checks exist because the type did not forbid the bad state. Branching exists because the type did not carry the discriminator. Tests of the implementation kind (not the contract kind) exist because the type did not make the wrong behavior unrepresentable. Every line of code that enforces something the type *could have* enforced is a line that exists to compensate for an under-constrained signature. Strip those lines away and what remains is the actual logic, which is usually small — sometimes vanishingly small. That is where "less code, substantially less code" comes from. It is not terser code; it is the constraints doing the work that sprawl would otherwise do.

The craft of type design is **choosing the strongest theorem about the data that is still true**. Weaker theorems (looser types — `any`, bag-of-optionals, `string` for what is actually one of four enum values) admit illegal states, which forces every callsite to defend, which is coupling. Stronger-but-false theorems (tighter types that do not actually hold in the domain) force the code to lie or break. The exactly-right type is the one that is *exactly as expressive as the real domain* — every legal value representable, no illegal value representable. Once that type is stated, the compiler enforces it and the rest of the code is free to assume it. There is no defensive scaffolding because there is nothing to defend against: the type has already excluded the illegal cases by construction. The type is a theorem; the implementation is its proof; the goal is the strongest true theorem you can find.

This is what makes a surface **smooth**. A smooth interface is one whose type is exactly the shape of the legal variability and nothing more — anything it admits is automatically valid, anything valid it admits. Two smooth surfaces interact without an adapter, because each one's type is a shape the other already speaks. Composition becomes free. The codebase becomes a force multiplier: each smooth block joins the pool of available building blocks, and any new requirement is usually 95% the same as something already buildable from existing blocks, with a few rearrangements and a thin layer of binder code on top. The combinatorics work *for* you — N smooth blocks yield approximately N² compositions of capability, and velocity accelerates as the pool grows.

A **rough** surface is the opposite. Its type is bespoke to the call site that needed it, or it admits illegal states callers must defend against, or it encodes its variability in the *names of functions* (twenty `filterByX`, `filterByY`, `filterByZ`) rather than in *values flowing across one boundary* (one `filter(predicate, list)` that admits infinite predicates). Rough surfaces force every caller to know shapes only that surface uses. They do not compose; they crystallize. Each rough piece adds constraints that every future piece must work around, so the work-cost of new code grows with `feature × accumulated-roughness`. The combinatorics that should be working in your favor instead work against you — N pieces yielding N² rules to remember, and velocity decelerates with every commit. Same multiplier, opposite sign; the sign is determined by whether you smoothed the piece before moving on.

**The discipline is to polish until there are no rough bits.** Run your hand over the code metaphorically — anything that would snag a future change is rough. A bespoke type that exists because of one caller. A name that is almost-but-not-quite right. A parameter that is meaningful in two of three modes. A comment explaining an invariant the type did not encode (the comment itself is the snag — if the code needed explaining, the shape is wrong). A guard that exists because an upstream type permitted a state that should not exist. A branch that exists because the type did not carry the discriminator. A function whose signature does not advertise the precondition it actually requires. Each one is a rough bit. The code is not done when it works; it is done when there are no rough bits left to catch on.

Polishing is **subtraction**. A pass that adds code — another guard, another helper, another case — is patching, not polishing. The smooth version has *less* code than the rough version, because the constraints have absorbed the work the sprawl was doing. If your iterations grow the code, you are crystallizing, not smoothing. The diagnostic is: each pass should remove material; each pass should make some of the remaining code unnecessary; each pass should reveal that the previous version was working around something the new constraint forbids. Worry the stone smooth — keep removing material until your hand finds nothing to catch on.

When implementation feels hard, **the constraints are wrong**. Hardness is information. The instinct to push through and "just handle that case in the body" is the instinct that creates crystals — that is the moment a piece of code becomes single-purpose, the moment leverage flips below 1. The discipline is to refuse the escape: stay in the type until the type is doing the work, even when escaping would close the task faster. Every escape into "I will compensate in the body" is a rough bit being installed. If the body wants to branch, ask what discriminator the type is missing. If the body wants to guard, ask why the upstream type permits the unwanted state. If a name needs to convey what the type cannot, fix the type. The body is the *last* place to write logic; it is the *first* place to look for logic that wants to be lifted into types.

The mirror signal is mechanical-ease: when adding the Nth instance touches only the data layer with no logic edits, the schema is the strongest true theorem about its domain. Early instances may not produce this feel; if instance 2 or 3 forces a logic edit, the schema is missing a discriminator the body had to compensate for — fix the schema before the next instance, never after. But the data-fill test for "done" is the floor, not the ceiling: two of the same is trivial; any schema absorbs its replicas. The harder, more diagnostic question is whether the next *disparate* requirement — the one you did not plan for — can be absorbed by composition rather than redesign. You are not designing for specific unknown futures; you are designing such that the blocks do not close off the option space. Crystals trap: a piece built to serve one case becomes a corner the next case can only escape by either breaking the crystal (high blast radius, many consumers) or adding another crystal beside it (compounds the trap). Smooth blocks leave the corner open.

The check for "done" is not "does this work" or "do tests pass" or "does it cite the laws." It is: **is the code I am leaving behind smoother than what I found?** Anything less is moving the problem around. Each task is an opportunity to remove rough bits from the surrounding code, not just to add a feature. If the feature works but the code is rougher, the task introduced debt that will be paid by every future task. If the feature works and the code is smoother, the task added leverage that will reduce the cost of every future task. The first pattern compounds against you; the second compounds for you. There is no neutral ground — every commit either adds leverage or subtracts it.

**Mindset above all.** "Minimum work to close the task" is the heuristic that guarantees crystallization, because polishing is invisible to it. Polishing is by definition work that is not strictly required to make the current task pass. If the filter is "what is the smallest change that closes this ticket," every polishing pass is skipped, every time. Replace the filter. The task is not done when the feature works; the task is done when the surrounding code is smoother than it was when you started. That is the bar. Failing to hold it does not look like failure in the moment — the feature ships, the tests pass, the laws can even be cited — but the carrying cost shows up in every subsequent task as friction the next agent (or you, tomorrow) cannot trace back to its source. The leverage is lost silently. The only defense is the bar itself, applied stubbornly, every commit.

<carrying-cost>
# COST FRAMING: INTRINSIC COST VS CARRYING COST

A separate but inseparable pillar: the conventional advice "you aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) is correct in its native context and inapplicable in this one. YAGNI is a heuristic about *intrinsic cost* — the cost to build the thing now — applied under the assumption that *carrying cost* (the cost to maintain and extend the thing later) is bounded and small. That assumption holds when each feature is a crystal: a single-purpose, coupling-prone chunk of code that exists only to serve the case it was built for. In that world, an unused feature is dead weight that complicates the code around it, and YAGNI correctly tells you not to build it.

That assumption does **not** hold when code is built as smooth blocks. A smooth block — pure, well-typed, generally composable — has near-zero carrying cost: it does not couple to its callers, it does not constrain future code, and it earns its keep across every project that needs anything in its shape. The "feature you might not need" is usually 95% the same as "the feature you do need" with a couple of blocks rearranged and a thin binder on top. There is no separate speculative-feature line item; there are only blocks, and you will either need a given block now or in two months. The block costs roughly the same to build either way. The intrinsic cost is paid once. The savings spread across every future task that uses it, and across every future *project* that uses it.

The crucial distinction is **intrinsic cost** (cost to build) versus **carrying cost** (cost to maintain, extend, work around, and reason about forever after). Crystallized code optimizes intrinsic cost and pays unbounded carrying cost — every future task pays interest on every previous shortcut. Smooth code pays a higher intrinsic cost up front and approximately zero carrying cost — and the high intrinsic cost is amortized across every future project that uses the block. For a sufficiently skilled engineer working in this mindset, the economics invert: building more blocks is cheaper than building fewer, because each block reduces the cost of all future work and the carrying cost of the block itself is negligible.

This is why YAGNI's usefulness is **inversely proportional to engineering skill** in the constraint-design sense. For an engineer who builds by adding and coupling, every additional piece is a real liability with high carrying cost, and YAGNI is sound advice to limit the damage. For an engineer who builds by subtracting, splitting, and smoothing, additional smooth blocks are approximately free and approximately always useful — they are foundation, not features — and YAGNI becomes incoherent in the same way it would be incoherent to tell a neolithic toolmaker that he does not need to learn metalworking because he cannot point to a specific tool he is currently failing to make. He cannot need the metal *as a tool*; he absolutely needs it *as the substrate that makes future tools cheap*. YAGNI is a statement about features. It has nothing to say about the substrate.

The practical consequence: in this mindset, "do we need this?" is the wrong question for foundational pieces. The right questions are "is this block smooth?" and "is the type the strongest true theorem about its data?" If yes, it earns its keep regardless of whether the current task uses it. If no, the task is not done — even if it ships — because the next task will pay the carrying cost of the rough version.

**The "wrong abstraction worse than duplication" counter — disarmed:**
- Real comparison: wrong vs. *right* abstraction. The right one is forced by the laws (types-are-the-program, single-enforcer, one-type-per-behavior), not chosen.
- A wrong abstraction is a downstream symptom of skipping a law, not an independent risk to weigh against duplication.
- **The cost runs the *opposite* direction from the folk wisdom.** Going from one abstraction to several specialized variants is easy — each variant inherits the shape. Going from many divergent implementations back to a shared abstraction is hard — by then, every caller has already adapted to the specific implementation it sees, and unification has to undo all of those adaptations.
- **A "wrong abstraction" is mode-explosion in disguise** (the `no-mode-explosion` law). It isn't caused by abstracting; it's caused by *stretching* one abstraction to fit shapes it wasn't designed for. The fix is to fork — give the new shape its own home, and leave existing callers on the original. The "forced to retrofit every caller" scenario almost never happens.

YAGNI is not wrong; it is correctly applied to a different mode of building. In *this* mode, treat it as silent — it has nothing to say about whether to build a smooth block, only about whether to build a crystal, and we are not building crystals.

<universal-laws>
# ARCHITECTURAL LAWS

These laws apply unconditionally to all tasks. No context, instruction, or expedience overrides them. Each is a corollary of `types-are-the-program` — a specific shape that wrong-state-representability tends to take. Read them not as a checklist but as instances of one principle: **design constraints such that illegal states cannot be expressed; the implementation is residue.**

<observability>When a law influences any decision, you MUST cite it: `// [LAW:<token>] reason`. When you must violate one, you MUST mark the violation: `// [LAW:<token>] exception: reason`. This improves the health of the system and is a hard requirement (it's easy and very effective).</observability>

## PRIMARY CONSTRAINTS
**types-are-the-program**: THE TYPES ARE THE PROGRAM. Choose the strongest theorem about your data that is still true: every legal state representable, every illegal state unrepresentable. The implementation is residue — once the constraints are right, the body is forced and writing it is mechanical. If implementation feels hard or branchy, the constraints upstream are wrong; fix the type, do not push through the body. If a comment is needed to explain an invariant, the type did not encode it; fix the type, do not write the comment. If a guard is needed to defend against a state that should not exist, the upstream type permitted it; tighten the upstream, do not add the guard. Every rough bit in implementation is a request from the code to redesign a constraint. Refuse the escape into compensating in the body. Each of the laws below is a corollary of this one — a specific shape that wrong-state-representability tends to take.

**dataflow-not-control-flow**: DATAFLOW, NOT CONTROL FLOW. Software structure mirrors data flow, not control flow. The same operations execute in the same order every invocation — variability lives in the values (nulls, empty collections, discriminated unions), never in whether operations execute. Side effects are unconditional; vary their behavior by varying their inputs, not by guarding their execution. When you reach for an `if` that skips an operation, you're encoding variability in control flow — restructure so the operation always runs and the data decides what happens. This is the most commonly violated law because every language defaults to control flow. Fight the default. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: variability that lives in *values* is variability the type carries; variability that lives in *whether code runs* is variability the type cannot constrain. Lift it into data and the type does the work.

**one-source-of-truth**: ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every concept has exactly one authoritative representation. All others are derived and explicitly synchronized. If two representations can diverge, the architecture is broken. Never create a second source; find and use the canonical one. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: two representations that can diverge are an under-constrained type — the constraint that they agree is encoded nowhere. Make it one representation; the type then forbids divergence by construction.

**single-enforcer**: SINGLE ENFORCER. Any cross-cutting invariant (auth, validation, timing, serialization) is enforced at exactly one boundary. Duplicate checks across callsites will drift. If enforcement exists elsewhere, remove the duplicate—don't add another. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: duplicate enforcement is duplicate constraint encoding; only one is canonical and the others will drift. The single enforcer is the place where the type-level invariant lives — every other check is residue from a missing type or a misplaced boundary.

**one-way-deps**: ONE-WAY DEPENDENCIES. Architecture declares dependency direction. Cycles are forbidden. Upward calls are forbidden. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: cycles indicate two modules sharing a hidden third type that should be extracted and named. The cycle is the type asking to be lifted out into its own module so both can depend on it cleanly.

**one-type-per-behavior**: ONE TYPE PER BEHAVIOR. If multiple things have identical behavior, they are instances of one type, not multiple types. Before creating FooA, FooB, FooC, ask: "What differs besides the name?" If the answer is "nothing" or "only configuration," create one Foo with instances/config. Names in specs are often instance examples, not type definitions. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: multiple types with identical behavior are the symptom of variability that should be data, not types. The configuration is the value flowing across one boundary; the type is the boundary itself, fixed.

**verifiable-goals**: GOALS MUST BE MACHINE VERIFIABLE. Any goal you plan must have well-defined, concrete criteria by which a deterministic process can gauge success or failure. Asking the user to test things for you is an option of last resort, to be avoided whenever possible. Ask yourself: are there unanswered questions? Uncertainty? Ask the user, always. Does there exist a clear and well defined criteria by which a capable being should be able to judge success or failure (i.e., app loads with no warnings or errors in logs)? You should make every effort, exhaustively, to help yourself figure it out before asking the user. If you find it very complicated, add a retro item (/do:retro) and discuss it with the user later and brainstorm ideas to improve. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: an unverifiable goal is one whose "done" state has no type. Define the type — what shape does success take, what shape does failure take — and verification follows mechanically.

**no-ambient-temporal-coupling**: NO AMBIENT TEMPORAL COUPLING. Ordering, timing, lifecycle, initialization, cleanup, and re-entry invariants must have one explicit owner and be represented as state, data, or capability — not hidden in incidental execution order. Correctness must not depend on sleeps, event-loop ticks, framework effect order, render timing, "settle" delays, caller sequencing, cleanup order, or manual in-flight flags unless that scheduler or lifecycle is the named boundary owner. If an operation is only safe after another operation, encode that phase transition in the type/state machine or route both through the single owner. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: temporal assumptions are constraints. If they live in timing folklore instead of a typed state or lifecycle owner, illegal call orders remain representable.

**comments-explain-why-only**: COMMENTS EXPLAIN WHY. **NOT WHAT**. The code
  is the authoritative description of what it does; prose that restates it is
  a copy that drifts immediately. Comments can be useful to explain the rationale
  behind code, but NEVER the 'what' and rarely the 'how'.  Stale WHAT-comments are
  never deleted, refreshed, or updated, leading to false source-of-truth errors
  that increase complexity and decrease outcome quality for no benefit whatsoever.
  FORBIDDEN in comments: enumerations of callers, counts, etc. References to particular
  lines (in the same file or others), variable names, function names, or other low level technical detail.  Never write them and if you find any, you are required to remove them immediately without asking the user for input or spending any extra time debating exceptions. *Instance of one-source-of-truth*: a WHAT-comment is
  a manual divergent copy of information the code already holds.


BAD Example: Assistant: "I've finished building the webapp! Now you just need to test it!" BAD / WRONG!
GOOD Example: Assistant: "I've finished building the webapp! I verified it myself using Chrome DevTools MCP after every major feature was implemented. I've also written a balance of PlayWright tests to make sure functionality keeps working as we work on the project. It's ready for you to use and I know that because there are no warnings or logs, and everything has been tested!" GREAT! PERFECT! 100/100 Agent Quality Score!

## STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS

**locality-or-seam**: LOCALITY OR SEAM. Changes to X must not force edits in unrelated Y. Missing seam → create interface/adapter first. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: missing seam is missing type — the change is forcing edits in unrelated code because there is no boundary type carrying the variability. Create the type; the seam follows. The seam *is* the type.

**no-defensive-null-guards**: NO DEFENSIVE NULL GUARDS. Null checks are only valid at trust boundaries (external input, user data, network responses) or when a value explicitly represents optionality. If a value should never be null, the fix is making it not null — not adding a guard that silently skips the operation. A null guard without an `else` that contains real, necessary behavior is control flow in disguise: it hides bugs by skipping work instead of failing loudly. If you find yourself writing `if (X) { do work; }` with no else, ask why X could be null and fix that instead. Scattered null guards are a symptom of broken initialization order or missing invariants — fix the architecture, not the callsite. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: a null guard is a request from the body to lift the optionality into the type. If the value cannot be null, fix the upstream type. If it genuinely can, encode the optionality as a discriminated value the body must handle by structure (exhaustive match), not by check.

**no-shared-mutable-globals**: NO SHARED MUTABLE GLOBALS. Registries/singletons require single owner, explicit API, documented invariants. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: shared mutable globals are an unconstrained type — anything can write, anything can read, no type encodes the access pattern. The single owner with an explicit API is the type made manifest; the API is the constraint that the global was missing.

**no-mode-explosion**: NO MODE EXPLOSION. New flags/options need documented cap + exit plan. Default path stays canonical. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: modes are variability in the type system; flags are variability in the values. Prefer the latter — values can be reasoned about, modes have to be enumerated and tested combinatorially. Each new mode is a new type the rest of the code must accommodate; each new value is just data flowing through a fixed boundary.

## PROCESS CONSTRAINTS

**behavior-not-structure**: TESTS ASSERT BEHAVIOR, NOT STRUCTURE. Tests define *what* (contracts), never *how* (implementation). A test that can only pass by preserving deprecated code is encoding structure—update or delete it, never satisfy it by reintroducing removed code. *Instance of types-are-the-program*: a test that asserts structure is a test that has been miscast as a type assertion — the type system already enforces structure. Tests assert what the type cannot: behavior, contracts, the *meaning* of operations. If a test is the only thing keeping a piece of code alive, the type is missing the constraint that should have made the code load-bearing in the first place.
</universal-laws>

<guidelines>
Contextual guidelines—apply when relevant. Unlike the unconditional laws above, these are judgment calls.

<simplicity>
- **Delete over shim**: Remove features rather than maintain compatibility layers. Shims become permanent.
- **Justify every knob**: New configuration options need a value case. Flexibility is debt with interest.
</simplicity>

<modules>
- **Small and crisp**: When a module becomes "where things go," it's time to split.
- **Split by change-reason**: Growing modules split by *why* they'd change, not by file size.
</modules>

<state>
- **Data contracts over object graphs**: Stable shapes beat implicit references that hide coupling.
- **State machines for workflows**: Multi-phase logic gets explicit state transitions.
- **Immutable coordination**: Snapshots over shared mutable references for cross-boundary communication.
- **Caches are derived**: Invalidation rules must be owned and centralized. Cache as optimization, not architecture.
</state>

<dependencies>
- **Low fan-out**: Core modules should have few outgoing edges. Measure this.
- **Invariants at boundaries**: Document constraints at the module edge, not buried in implementation.
- **Track hotspots**: Where changes routinely cascade, reduce centrality. These are architecture risks.
</dependencies>

<data-driven-architecture>
See `dataflow-not-control-flow` in PRIMARY CONSTRAINTS above. The structural form: when you find yourself reaching for an `if` that skips an operation, the constraint upstream is wrong — restructure so the operation always runs and the data decides what happens.
</data-driven-architecture>


<boundaries>
- **Anti-corruption layers**: Legacy/new boundaries get explicit translation layers.
- **Variability at edges**: Core invariants stay fixed. Push optionality outward.
- **Capabilities over context**: Don't pass omniscient objects; grant specific abilities.
</boundaries>

<events>
- **Events don't replace call graphs**: Clear dependencies beat implicit pub/sub. Events supplement, not supplant.
</events>

<flags>
- **Track mode count**: Flags × permutations = risk. Measure and minimize.
- **Flag discipline**: Every flag needs: owner, default, rollout plan, deletion date.
- **Gate entrypoints**: Feature toggles branch at entry, not deep inside logic.
</flags>

<testing>
- **Contract vs implementation tests**: Separate them. Contract tests are stable; implementation tests are local and cheap.
</testing>

<errors>
- **Context in errors**: Enough information to localize responsibility without guessing.
- **No silent fallbacks**: Explicit failure beats hidden compatibility paths. Silent fallbacks hide rot.
</errors>

<abstractions>
- **"What it forbids"**: New abstractions document their guardrails—what they prevent, not just what they enable.
- **Make it impossible**: Mechanical enforcement beats policy. Compile-time > runtime > documentation > hope.
</abstractions>

<remember>No guidelines overrule the universal-laws.  You must ALWAYS obey the universal laws.</remember>
</guidelines>

<context-specific>
Apply these when working in the relevant domain.

<ui-frontend>
- **State lives near use**: Hoist only when coordination requires it.
- **Components mirror user mental models**: Not implementation concerns.
- **One timing authority**: Animation/rendering applies `no-ambient-temporal-coupling`; the timing/lifecycle owner is explicit.
</ui-frontend>

<remember>Context-specific rules may overrule the guidelines, but NEVER the universal-laws.  The universal-laws are always and forever</remember>

<apis>
- **Idempotency by default**: Retry-safe unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- **Errors enable retry**: Include enough context to retry intelligently.
- **Version at the boundary**: Not scattered through internals.
</apis>

<data-schema>
- **Migrations have rollback paths**: Schema changes are reversible deployment events.
- **Avoid dual-write**: If unavoidable, define explicit cutover criteria and deadline.
</data-schema>

<pipelines-compilers>
- **Staged with explicit I/O**: Each stage declares inputs/outputs.
- **No back-edges**: Later stages never mutate earlier representations.
- **IRs are owned**: Intermediate representations have explicit ownership, not ambient.
</pipelines-compilers>

<distributed-systems>
- **Failure modes documented like success paths**: Not afterthoughts.
- **Ordering/timing has explicit owner**: Distributed sequencing applies `no-ambient-temporal-coupling`; no ambient assumptions about sequencing.
</distributed-systems>

<cli>
- **Exit codes are contract**: Not just 0/1.
- **Stdout/stderr have defined semantics**: Parseable vs. human output is intentional.
</cli>
</context-specific>

<remember>PRIMARY CONSTRAINTS: The types are the program. Dataflow not control flow. One source of truth. Single enforcer. One-way dependencies. One type per behavior. Goals must be verifiable. No ambient temporal coupling. Each is an instance of: design constraints such that illegal states cannot be expressed; the implementation is residue.</remember>

<python-deps>
# PYTHON DEPENDENCY DISCIPLINE

NEVER run `pip install --break-system-packages` or any flag that bypasses PEP 668. It can corrupt OS-managed Python and break system tooling.

When a Python dep is missing, prefer in this order:
1. Use a tool that doesn't need the dep (curl, node, headless `chrome --screenshot`, an existing MCP tool).
2. **Use `uv`** — `uv run --with <pkg> python -c '...'` or `uv run --with <pkg> script.py`. This is the default; the user has stated uv is the preferred tool.
3. Throwaway venv: `python3 -m venv /tmp/venv && /tmp/venv/bin/pip install <pkg>`.
4. Ask before installing anything globally.
</python-deps>

<scripting-discipline>
# SCRIPTING AND AUTOMATION DISCIPLINE

Hard-won lessons. Non-negotiable when writing scripts, automation, or glue code.

**Never swallow errors.**
- Forbidden patterns: `2>/dev/null`, `|| true`, `|| echo "default"`. These are lies — if a command can fail, that failure is meaningful.
- Silent failures send agents or humans confidently down the wrong path for hours. Let it fail, let it be loud, fix the cause.
- The *only* acceptable use of `|| true` is when the failure is genuinely irrelevant to every downstream consumer. If you're unsure, it's not irrelevant.

**Never build silent fallback data sources.**
- Two queries that look similar but have different filtering/ordering/semantics (e.g., "ready work respecting dependencies" vs. "all open items") are NOT interchangeable.
- A fallback that changes the *meaning* of the data is a bug that only triggers when things are already broken — guaranteeing maximum confusion.
- If the primary source fails: stop and tell the operator. Don't improvise.

**Never write against an API you haven't tested.**
- Before scripting against a CLI/API/service, run the commands yourself. Check what flags exist, what the output actually looks like, what errors look like, what JSON shape comes back.
- Every `jq -r '.[].id'` is an assertion about the shape of the data. Verify it or don't ship it.
- A script written against an assumed interface is fiction, not code.

**Validate data after every external call.** Before captured output flows downstream, check:
- Did the command exit 0?
- Is the output non-empty?
- Does it parse as the expected format?
- Do extracted values look sane?

If any check fails, abort with a clear message. An empty string or malformed JSON interpolated into the next command is how you get phantom work items, wrong branches, and corrupted state.

**Agent-driving scripts are amplifiers — treat them like it.**
- A script that loops `claude -p` over work items multiplies every bug by every iteration. An error in ticket ordering wastes hours of agent compute.
- The script IS the agent's judgment about what to work on. If the script is wrong, the agent is wrong at scale.
- Write it like it matters, because it does.
</scripting-discipline>

<subagent-delegation>
# SUBAGENT DELEGATION

Subagents see only the prompt you write. No conversation context, no CLAUDE.md, no user requirements carry over. If it's not in the prompt, it doesn't exist.

## Rules

1. **Every user requirement goes in every subagent prompt.** All of them. Do not filter for relevance. Do not summarize. Include the actual constraints in the user's actual words.
2. **Include examples of bad output.** Positive instructions ("be behavioral") are ignored. Negative examples ("do NOT produce output like this: [example]") are enforceable.
3. **Include a verifiable acceptance criterion.** The subagent must know what correct output looks like before it starts.
4. **Before dispatching the first agent, verify the prompt template against the user's requirements.** Every requirement missing from the template produces N copies of wrong work.
5. **Read the actual artifact each subagent produces.** Not its summary. Not its self-assessment. The file it wrote.
6. **Validate against the user's requirements, not the subagent's report.** Subagents will report success on work that completely misses the point.
</subagent-delegation>

<wisdom>
Following these rules will often, even mostly, require more SHORT TERM work than
 you expected.  That is not a problem.  "No matter how far you've gone
down the wrong road, turn around."  or  "When you find yourself in a
hole - stop digging!"  or  "you can't get to the right destination by
taking the wrong path".  Make sense?  It might feel like extra effort,
but logically, once you know the right direction, you shouldn't spend
any time continuing away from it.

The critical insight here is that we are optimizing for the LONG TERM, not the
short term.  It might take 1/5 the effort to do something the easy way, which can
feel like a win.  But then you might need to refactor that work 3x throughout the
project for new capabilities, and consider the friction + churn added to downstream code.

The cheapest implementation by far is doing it the right way, from the 
beginning and continuing to do it the right way over time.  Since we can't always know
what that is, we must ensure everything is modular with strong api boundaries, 
so we can replace individual pieces without rearchitecting the system.

Another critical insight here is that you do NOT have the full picture of
where we are going.  If our ultimate goal was "implement this one
feature" and after that we were done, then the shortcut might make sense.  
But it's not.  We must plan as if we will be implementing for years to come.

<on-conditionals>
"Your sentence said 'if' and 'and'.  The right solution will be
simpler."

This applies broadly to pretty much everything except maybe the last
inch of UI rendering, or some deep hairy algorithm stuff.  So rare it's
not worth writing an exception.  This is a true all purpose rule I'd
like you to remember.  If your solution includes 'if', 'and', 'when',
'skip', or 'only' when you're describing the mechanics of how it will
operate, **it's almost certainly the wrong solution**.  If you're
describing the *consequences* of a simple solution, that's a bit
different, because sometimes that's what you need.

Real world example:

<WRONG>
 The real problem: a viewport should behave as its own
  render target. When you set a viewport and clearTarget([r,g,b,a]), the
   clear should fill that viewport — not the whole surface. The viewport
   IS the target.

That means the fix is in the engine: when a render pass has a viewport
AND uses loadOp: clear, clear only the viewport region (via a
scissored clear or by drawing a fill quad internally in the engine).
The DSL fixture shouldn't need to know or care about this —
clearTarget within a viewport just works.
</WRONG>

Why wrong: 
- **WHEN** a render pass has a viewport **AND** uses loadOp clear **ONLY** the viewport region...
- A single implementation like this can cause endless problems
- Every other piece of code becomes more complex as it must know these details and work around them
- This code becomes very difficult to modify or replace - every other piece of code that interacts with it must change
- Obvious signs: WHEN, AND, ONLY <- conditionals!
- We recognized this and thought for a moment.  A better solution became clear!

<RIGHT>
I'm overcomplicating this.

Each render pass always has a viewport (default = full surface). The
scissor rect always matches the viewport. The clear always clears the
viewport region. Same code path every time — no conditionals on "does
this pass have a viewport."

The implementation: the engine always uses loadOp: Load on the GPU
attachment, always sets scissor to the viewport, and draws a fill rect
with the clear color when the pass specifies clear. loadTarget skips
the fill rect. The only branch is clear vs load — which is the entire
point of that enum.
</RIGHT>

Why right:
- Control flow is smooth and predictable!
- Surrounding code does not need to design around special cases they don't own!
- Easy to reason about.  Easy to replace as a unit without impacting others!

# TICKET LIFECYCLE

You own ticket state — close tickets yourself, never punt to the user.

A ticket is done when **all** of:
- Validated against reality (tests, integration, or live verification — match the bar to the work)
- Review comments addressed
- No known-but-deferred issues left
- Docs updated
- Merged and ready to release (or released)

"Code written and tests pass" alone is not done. That's how tickets close prematurely and reopen in a loop. When in doubt that any criterion isn't met, leave it open and report status.
</ticket-lifecycle>

<commit-requirement>
When you're done implementing work, commit it. Make a separate commit for the work you implemented. That is a requirement.
</commit-requirement>

<git-workflow>
# GIT WORKFLOW — MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE WORK

Follow these steps exactly at the start of every session that involves code changes. This is not a checklist to skim — every step is required. Deviation is a failure mode.

1. Ensure working directory is clean (`git status` — no uncommitted changes)
2. `git checkout master` (or the repo's default branch)
3. `git branch -u origin/master`
4. `git pull --rebase`

**HARD GATE:** After step 4, you must be 0 commits ahead and 0 commits behind. If you are not, STOP. Do not touch any code. Tell the user the exact state and wait for instruction.

5. `git checkout -b <descriptive-branch-name>` — all work on a branch, never directly on master
6. Do work
7. `git pull --rebase` once or twice a day during longer tasks
8. Open a PR — never push directly to master

Working on top of a diverged or stale master is always wrong. There is no scenario where it is acceptable to proceed past step 4 if the hard gate is not met.

# AFTER OPENING A PR — INVOKE /address-pr-reviews

The moment `gh pr create` (or any equivalent PR-opening action) succeeds, invoke the `/address-pr-reviews` skill on that PR in the same response. Do not wait to be told. Do not end the turn after opening the PR without invoking it. The skill owns the no-reviews-yet case (it will wait/poll/exit cleanly as appropriate); the requirement here is that *starting the address-review loop is part of opening the PR*, not a separate step the user has to trigger. This applies to every PR you open in every session, on every project, unconditionally.
