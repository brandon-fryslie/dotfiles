# STATUS REFERENCE: STATUS-2025-10-15-043506.md
# - Section 2: Justfile Commands table - many UNTESTED
# - Section 6: Gap 3 - Phantom justfile commands in documentation
#
# PLAN REFERENCE: PLAN-2025-10-15-110000.md
# - P1-1: Fix Phantom Justfile Commands in Documentation
# - P1-2: Verify and Test Existing Justfile Commands
#
# USER WORKFLOWS TESTED:
# 1. Documented commands actually exist
# 2. Commands work as documented
# 3. Commands produce expected output
# 4. Error handling works correctly
#
# GAMING RESISTANCE:
# - Tests actual command execution, not stubs
# - Verifies output content, not just exit codes
# - Checks file system state after command execution
# - Tests commands that have never been tested before
