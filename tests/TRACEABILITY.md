# Test Traceability Matrix

This document maps functional tests to STATUS gaps and PLAN work items, demonstrating which tests validate which requirements.

## Purpose

This traceability ensures:
1. Every critical gap identified in STATUS has corresponding tests
2. Every P0/P1 PLAN item has acceptance criteria validated by tests
3. Tests provide evidence that bugs are fixed
4. No critical functionality is left untested

## Traceability Format

```
TEST_FILE: test-name
├─ STATUS: Section X, Gap Y - Description
├─ PLAN: P0-X / P1-X - Work Item Name
├─ VALIDATES: Specific functionality or bug fix
└─ GAMING RESISTANCE: Why this test cannot be faked
```

## P0 (Critical) Coverage

### P0-1: Fix merge-json.sh Output Format

**STATUS:** Section 2, Gap 1 - merge-json.sh produces array instead of object
**PLAN:** P0-1 - Fix merge-json.sh Output Format

#### Tests

| Test File | Test Name | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh produces JSON object, not array | **CRITICAL** - Catches the exact bug identified in STATUS. Script must produce `{...}` not `[{...}, {...}]` |
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh merges two files correctly | Validates merge semantics: later overrides earlier |
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh merges multiple files with correct precedence | Validates 3+ file merge with correct precedence |
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh performs deep merge on nested objects | Validates nested object merging, not replacement |
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh works with WATCHERS.md example scenario | Validates documented use case from WATCHERS.md lines 147-155 |

**Would These Tests Have Caught the Bug?**
YES. The first test explicitly checks `jq 'type' output.json` and requires output to be "object", not "array". This would have failed immediately with the current buggy implementation.

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Tests create actual JSON files on filesystem
- Uses jq to inspect actual structure (cannot be faked)
- Verifies multiple aspects: type, content, merge semantics
- Tests documented examples (catches documentation vs. reality mismatch)

---

### P0-2: Document or Fix iCloud Drive Limitation

**STATUS:** Section 5, Risk 1 - iCloud Drive + launchd = INCOMPATIBLE
**PLAN:** P0-2 - Document or Fix iCloud Drive Limitation

#### Tests

This is primarily a documentation/architecture decision, not directly testable. However:

| Test File | Test Name | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| (Future) test-watchers.bats | watcher can execute from installed location | Would validate if iCloud workaround works |

**Note:** No tests written yet because decision pending: fix or remove watchers.

---

### P0-3: Remove or Create Missing install Wrapper Script

**STATUS:** Section 6, Gap 2 - Missing install script despite documentation
**PLAN:** P0-3 - Remove or Create Missing install Wrapper Script

#### Tests

| Test File | Test Name | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| test-installation.bats | installation method documented in README actually exists | Validates documented method matches reality |
| test-installation.bats | ./install script works if present | If script exists, tests it works as documented |
| test-installation.bats | ./install script supports work profile if present | Tests both profiles work via script |
| test-installation.bats | ./install script shows usage without arguments if present | Tests error handling |
| test-installation.bats | ./install script rejects invalid profile if present | Tests input validation |

**Would These Tests Have Caught the Gap?**
YES. First test checks if documented installation method exists. Would fail if README says to use `./install` but file doesn't exist.

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Tests actual file existence (cannot fake with stub)
- Tests script execution with actual arguments
- Validates error handling (not just happy path)
- Cross-references documentation with implementation

---

## P1 (High Priority) Coverage

### P1-1: Fix Phantom Justfile Commands in Documentation

**STATUS:** Section 6, Gap 3 - Phantom commands referenced in docs
**PLAN:** P1-1 - Fix Phantom Justfile Commands in Documentation

#### Tests

| Test File | Test Name | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| test-justfile-commands.bats | justfile contains all commands referenced in documentation | Commands in docs actually exist |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | phantom commands from documentation do not exist | Validates cleanup of phantom references |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | commands mentioned in README exist in justfile | README accuracy |

**Phantom Commands Identified:**
- `add-file-home` - Does not exist
- `test-home` - Should be `dry-run-home`
- `validate-yaml` - Should be `validate`

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Tests parse actual justfile via `just --list`
- Cannot be satisfied by documentation alone
- Cross-references multiple documents

---

### P1-2: Verify and Test Existing Justfile Commands

**STATUS:** Section 2, Justfile Commands table - many UNTESTED
**PLAN:** P1-2 - Verify and Test Existing Justfile Commands

#### Tests

| Test File | Test Name | Previously Tested? | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just verify-home validates home profile symlinks | NO | **First test ever** of verify-home |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just verify-work validates work profile symlinks | NO | **First test ever** of verify-work |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just backup creates backup of current dotfiles | NO | **First test ever** of backup |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just clean-broken removes broken symlinks | NO | **First test ever** of clean-broken |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just validate checks YAML syntax | YES | Previously tested (STATUS confirms) |
| test-justfile-commands.bats | just status shows active profile | YES | Previously tested (STATUS confirms) |

**Impact:**
These tests validate commands that have never been tested before. Status report shows verify-home, verify-work, backup, and clean-broken are UNTESTED.

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Tests actual command execution in temporary environment
- Verifies file system state changes (backups created, symlinks removed)
- Cannot be satisfied by exit code alone
- Tests both success and failure cases

---

### P1-3: Update WATCHERS.md Examples with Real Output

**STATUS:** Section 6, Gap 4 - WATCHERS.md shows untested examples
**PLAN:** P1-3 - Update WATCHERS.md Examples with Real Output

#### Tests

| Test File | Test Name | What It Validates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| test-merge-json.bats | merge-json.sh works with WATCHERS.md example scenario | Validates exact example from documentation |

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Uses exact input files from WATCHERS.md documentation
- Verifies output matches documented expectations
- Would catch documentation vs. reality mismatch

---

### P1-6: Remove or Fix Watchers System

**STATUS:** Section 6, Gap 1 - Watchers system non-functional
**PLAN:** P1-6 - Remove or Fix Watchers System

#### Tests

**Current Coverage:**
All merge-json.sh tests in test-merge-json.bats validate the core functionality needed for watchers.

**Missing Coverage (if watchers are fixed):**
- End-to-end watcher test (file change → merge triggered → output updated)
- launchd plist validation
- iCloud workaround validation

**Note:** Full watcher tests depend on P0-2 decision.

---

## Core Functionality Coverage

### Installation and Profile Management

| Test File | Test Name | User Workflow |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| test-installation.bats | just install-home creates symlinks in home directory | Fresh install - home profile |
| test-installation.bats | just install-work creates work profile symlinks | Fresh install - work profile |
| test-installation.bats | just install-global creates only global symlinks | Global config only |
| test-installation.bats | switching profiles updates symlink targets | Profile switching |
| test-installation.bats | profile configs override global configs (composition) | Configuration composition |
| test-installation.bats | fresh installation from README instructions works | **Complete user journey** |
| test-installation.bats | running install twice does not break configuration | Idempotency |
| test-installation.bats | created symlinks point to existing files | Symlink validation |

**User Impact:**
These tests validate the core mission of the dotfiles repository: managing configuration files across profiles.

**Gaming Resistance:**
- Tests in temporary HOME directory (cannot affect user's real files)
- Verifies actual symlink targets (not just existence)
- Tests complete workflows, not isolated functions
- Validates idempotency (safe to re-run)

## Gap Analysis: What's NOT Tested

### Intentionally Not Tested (Yet)

1. **Watcher end-to-end functionality** - Pending architecture decision (P0-2)
2. **P2 work items** - Lower priority, future sprint
3. **P3 enhancements** - Nice-to-have features
4. **Platform-specific edge cases** - macOS-only features

### Should Be Tested But Aren't (Future Work)

1. **Backup/restore cycle** - Test that backup can be restored (P3-3)
2. **Migration from install_dotfiles.sh** - Test upgrade path
3. **Error recovery** - Test recovery from interrupted installation
4. **Large-scale configs** - Test performance with many files
5. **Concurrent installations** - Test race conditions

### Cannot Be Tested Easily

1. **Shell loading** - Requires actual shell session
2. **Interactive prompts** - If any commands have them
3. **System-specific behavior** - Different macOS versions
4. **iCloud sync** - External system dependency

---

## Test Quality Metrics

### Gaming Resistance Score: 9/10

**Why 9/10:**
- Tests verify actual file system state ✓
- Tests check file content, not just existence ✓
- Tests validate structure (object vs array) ✓
- Tests cross-reference documentation ✓
- Tests use real tools (jq, dotbot) ✓
- Tests run in isolated environment ✓
- Tests verify multiple outcomes per workflow ✓
- Tests check error handling ✓
- Tests validate idempotency ✓
- Cannot test everything (shell loading, etc.) ✗

**Hardest to Game:**
1. `merge-json.sh produces JSON object, not array` - Requires actual jq type check
2. `created symlinks point to existing files` - Requires symlink resolution
3. `switching profiles updates symlink targets` - Requires before/after comparison
4. `fresh installation from README instructions works` - Complete workflow validation

**Easiest to Game (but still hard):**
1. `justfile has valid syntax` - Could be satisfied by minimal justfile
2. `repository has required directory structure` - Could fake directories
3. `commands requiring arguments show usage` - Could hardcode help text

But even "easiest" tests require real implementation because they're combined with other tests that verify actual functionality.

## Validation: Did Tests Catch Known Bugs?

### Known Bug: merge-json.sh produces array

**STATUS:** "merge-json.sh produces WRONG OUTPUT (returns array instead of merged object)"

**Test:** `test-merge-json.bats: merge-json.sh produces JSON object, not array`

**Would it catch the bug?** YES

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Current buggy behavior:
$ ./scripts/merge-json.sh out.json base.json override.json
$ jq 'type' out.json
"array"  # ← BUG

# Test checks:
assert_json_type "$TEST_DIR/output.json" "object"  # ← Would FAIL

# This test would have caught the bug before it was documented.
```

### Known Gap: Missing install script

**STATUS:** "Missing 'install' wrapper script despite documentation claiming it exists"

**Test:** `test-installation.bats: installation method documented in README actually exists`

**Would it catch the gap?** YES

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Test checks both methods:
if [ -f "$DOTFILES_ROOT/install" ]; then
  [ -x "$DOTFILES_ROOT/install" ]  # Check it's executable
else
  # Fallback to justfile
  require_just
fi

# If README says use ./install but it doesn't exist, test fails.
```

### Known Gap: Phantom commands

**STATUS:** "Documentation references non-existent justfile commands"

**Test:** `test-justfile-commands.bats: justfile contains all commands referenced in documentation`

**Would it catch the gap?** YES

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Test checks for documented commands:
assert_contains "$output" "add-file-home"  # ← Would FAIL (doesn't exist)

# Documents require fixing or command requires implementing.
```

---

## Continuous Validation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bats tests/functional/

# Run specific test file
bats tests/functional/test-merge-json.bats

# Run with verbose output
bats -t tests/functional/

# Run and show timing
bats --timing tests/functional/
```

### Pre-commit Integration

Tests should run on:
- Before commit (via pre-commit hook)
- On pull request (via CI)
- After any script changes
- After any configuration changes

### CI Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run functional tests
  run: bats tests/functional/

- name: Check merge-json.sh specifically
  run: bats tests/functional/test-merge-json.bats

- name: Verify critical bug is fixed
  run: |
    # Ensure merge-json.sh produces object, not array
    ./scripts/merge-json.sh /tmp/out.json tests/fixtures/base.json tests/fixtures/override.json
    if ! jq -e 'type == "object"' /tmp/out.json; then
      echo "CRITICAL: merge-json.sh still produces array!"
      exit 1
    fi
```
