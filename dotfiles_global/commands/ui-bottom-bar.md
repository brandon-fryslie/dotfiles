Bottom Logs Bar UI Specification:

Collapsed State (Default):
- Fixed at bottom of screen, full width, thin height
- Shows summary content (1-2 lines)
- Entire bar clickable with hover indication
- Visual cue (up arrow/chevron) shows it can expand

Expanded State (On Click):
- Expands upward to larger height
- Shows full scrollable content area
- Header with close button
- Click outside or close button collapses back down
- Smooth transition animation

Interaction:
- Single click to expand/collapse
- Progressive disclosure pattern - brief info when collapsed, full details when expanded
- Non-blocking minimal footprint when not in use

This focuses purely on the UI behavior pattern without specifying content or application functionality.
