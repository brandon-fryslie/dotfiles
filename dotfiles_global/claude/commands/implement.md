If specific areas of focus are defined below, focus entirely on those goals and architectural work to enable those goals.  If 'specific-areas-of-focus' is empty, use the latest STATUS and PLAN files 

Specific areas of focus:
<specific-areas-of-focus>
$ARGUMENTS
</specific-areas-of-focus>

Implement the plan until it is fully functional, with no fallbacks, shortcuts, or skipped work.
