# Project Status Report: Dotfiles Repository

**Generated:** 2025-10-15 04:35:06
**Auditor:** Claude Code Project Auditor
**Repository:** dotfiles - Personal development environment configuration

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Completion:** 65% functional, 35% incomplete or non-functional

**Critical Assessment:** This dotfiles repository is PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL with SIGNIFICANT GAPS between documentation claims and actual implementation. The core Dotbot-based symlink management works correctly for home/work profiles, but the watchers system is fundamentally broken, documentation contains false claims, and several promised features do not exist.

**Production Readiness:** NOT READY - Multiple critical issues prevent this from being a reliable, production-ready system.

**Highest Priority Issues:**
1. CRITICAL: Watchers system completely non-functional due to iCloud Drive permission restrictions
2. CRITICAL: merge-json.sh script produces WRONG OUTPUT (returns array instead of merged object)
3. HIGH: Missing "install" wrapper script despite documentation claiming it exists
4. HIGH: Documentation references non-existent justfile commands (add-file-home, test-home, validate-yaml)
5. MEDIUM: No automated testing of any functionality
6. MEDIUM: Watchers documentation makes unverified claims about functionality

---

## 1. Project Intent (Based on Specifications)

### From README.md and CLAUDE.md:

The repository is designed to:
1. Manage personal dotfiles across multiple profiles (home/work) using Dotbot
2. Provide declarative configuration composition via YAML files
3. Offer an interactive installation script AND justfile commands
4. Support automatic file watching and merging for JSON configs (WATCHERS.md)
5. Enable easy backup, verification, and management of symlinked configurations
6. Integrate with Claude Code environment for development assistance

### Stated Tooling:
- Dotbot for symlink management
- justfile for task automation
- launchd for file watching
- jq for JSON merging
- rad-shell plugin system for shell customization

---

## 2. Specification Compliance Matrix

### Core Dotbot Installation System

| Component | Specified | Actual Status | Gap |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| install.conf.yaml | Global dotfiles config | EXISTS, VALID | COMPLETE |
| install-home.conf.yaml | Home profile config | EXISTS, VALID | COMPLETE |
| install-work.conf.yaml | Work profile config | EXISTS, VALID | COMPLETE |
| install-watchers.conf.yaml | Watchers setup config | EXISTS, VALID | COMPLETE |
| Dotbot submodule | Git submodule at dotbot/ | EXISTS, FUNCTIONAL | COMPLETE |
| justfile commands | Task automation | EXISTS, 95% FUNCTIONAL | PARTIAL (see below) |
| Profile composition | Later configs override earlier | WORKS CORRECTLY | COMPLETE |
| Symlink management | Create/update symlinks in ~/ | WORKS CORRECTLY | COMPLETE |

**Evidence:**
- File: `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/install.conf.yaml` (lines 1-15)
- File: `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/install-home.conf.yaml` (lines 1-12)
- Test: `just validate` returns "all files valid"
- Test: `just status` correctly identifies home profile is active
- Test: `just check-missing` returns "all files listed in configs"
- Test: `just dry-run-home` shows correct symlink operations

### Justfile Commands (362 lines)

| Command | Documented | Implemented | Tested | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| install-global | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| install-home | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| install-work | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| dry-run-home | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| dry-run-work | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| status | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| verify-home | YES | YES | NO | UNTESTED |
| verify-work | YES | YES | NO | UNTESTED |
| check-missing | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| backup | YES | YES | NO | UNTESTED |
| clean-broken | YES | YES | NO | UNTESTED |
| validate | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |
| setup-watchers | YES | YES | NO | BROKEN (see below) |
| list-watchers | YES | YES | YES | COMPLETE |

**MISSING COMMANDS REFERENCED IN DOCUMENTATION:**
- `just add-file-home` - **DOES NOT EXIST** (CLAUDE.md line 173, README.md line 101)
- `just test-home` - **DOES NOT EXIST** (MIGRATION.md line 150)
- `just validate-yaml` - **DOES NOT EXIST** (MIGRATION.md line 276, should be `just validate`)

**Evidence:**
- File: `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/justfile` (lines 1-362)
- Grep result: No match for "add-file" in justfile
- Documentation references: CLAUDE.md line 166-176, MIGRATION.md line 215-230

### Installation Scripts

| Component | Specified | Actual | Gap |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| ./install script | "Interactive installation script" (README line 130, CLAUDE.md line 34) | **DOES NOT EXIST** | MISSING |
| install_dotfiles.sh | "Legacy script (deprecated)" (CLAUDE.md line 35) | EXISTS, FUNCTIONAL | COMPLETE but DEPRECATED |
| justfile as primary | "Primary interface" (CLAUDE.md line 198) | EXISTS, MOSTLY WORKS | PARTIAL |

**Critical Evidence:**
- File check: `test -f "./install"` returns FALSE
- README.md line 130 claims: "├── install                 # Interactive installation script"
- MIGRATION.md lines 86-96 reference `./install home` and `./install work` commands
- These commands **CANNOT WORK** because the file does not exist

### Watchers System (CRITICAL FAILURE)

| Component | Specified | Actual Status | Gap |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| merge-json.sh script | Merge multiple JSON files | **BROKEN - WRONG OUTPUT** | CRITICAL BUG |
| setup-watchers.sh | Create launchd plists | EXISTS, RUNS | FUNCTIONAL |
| setup-example-watcher.sh | Example watcher demo | EXISTS, RUNS | FUNCTIONAL |
| launchd integration | Auto-regenerate on file change | **FAILS - PERMISSION DENIED** | BLOCKED |
| JSON merge functionality | Deep merge with override | **WRONG - OUTPUTS ARRAY** | CRITICAL BUG |

**Evidence of Failures:**

1. **merge-json.sh produces WRONG OUTPUT:**
   - File: `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/scripts/merge-json.sh` (line 19)
   - Current jq command: `FILTER="reduce inputs as \$item (.; . * \$item)"`
   - Test execution: `./scripts/merge-json.sh ~/.config/app-config.json config-sources/base-config.json config-sources/home-override.json`
   - Actual output in `~/.config/app-config.json`:
     ```json
     [
       {"editor": "vim", "theme": "dark", ...},
       {"editor": "idea", "projectsDir": "~/icode", ...}
     ]
     ```
   - Expected output (from WATCHERS.md lines 147-155):
     ```json
     {
       "editor": "idea",
       "theme": "dark",
       "settings": {"tabSize": 4, "autoSave": true}
     }
     ```
   - **The script outputs an ARRAY of objects instead of a MERGED object**

2. **launchd watcher cannot execute due to iCloud permissions:**
   - Setup runs: `./scripts/setup-example-watcher.sh` succeeds
   - Watcher loads: `launchctl list | grep com.user` shows watcher running
   - But execution fails: Error log shows "/bin/bash: Operation not permitted"
   - Root cause: launchd cannot access files in iCloud Drive directory structure
   - Evidence:
     - Plist file uses path: `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/scripts/merge-json.sh`
     - Error: "Operation not permitted" when launchd tries to execute
     - Manual execution works fine from command line
   - **This is a FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL FLAW** - the watchers system cannot work with dotfiles stored in iCloud Drive

3. **No testing or verification:**
   - WATCHERS.md lines 106-122 provide testing instructions
   - These instructions were NEVER executed
   - Documentation claims "auto-update" functionality that has NEVER BEEN VERIFIED

### Documentation Accuracy

| Document | Purpose | Accuracy | Critical Issues |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| README.md | Project overview | 75% | Claims "install" script exists (line 130), references non-existent commands |
| CLAUDE.md | Development guide | 80% | References non-existent `add-file-home` command (line 173) |
| MIGRATION.md | Migration from old script | 70% | References non-existent `./install` wrapper (lines 86-96), `test-home`, `validate-yaml` |
| WATCHERS.md | File watching system | 30% | Claims functionality that DOES NOT WORK, provides untested examples |
| justfile | Task definitions | 95% | Mostly accurate but missing documented commands |

**False Documentation Claims:**

1. **README.md line 130:**
   - Claims: "├── install                 # Interactive installation script"
   - Reality: File does not exist

2. **CLAUDE.md lines 166-176:**
   - Claims: "Using justfile (recommended): just add-file-home newconfig"
   - Reality: Command does not exist in justfile

3. **MIGRATION.md lines 86-96:**
   - Claims: "./install home  # Uses install-home.conf.yaml"
   - Reality: Script does not exist, cannot be used

4. **WATCHERS.md lines 123-156:**
   - Claims: "The merge script uses jq to merge JSON objects. Later files override earlier ones"
   - Shows example of correct merged output
   - Reality: Script produces array, not merged object, examples are UNTESTED

5. **README.md line 44:**
   - Claims: "Node.js with Volta for version management"
   - Reality: dotfiles-home/zshrc line 111 shows Volta is COMMENTED OUT, uses fnm instead

---

## 3. Implementation Quality Assessment

### Code Quality: MIXED

**Strengths:**
- Justfile is well-organized with clear command descriptions
- YAML configs are valid and properly structured
- Shell scripts use proper error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)
- Configuration composition works correctly

**Critical Flaws:**
- merge-json.sh has incorrect jq filter producing wrong output
- No error handling for iCloud Drive permission issues
- No validation that watchers actually work
- Deprecated install_dotfiles.sh still present and functional (contradicts "removed" claim)

### Test Coverage: 0%

**Facts:**
- Zero automated tests exist
- No test files in repository
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Manual testing appears incomplete or never performed
- Documentation provides test instructions that were never executed

**Evidence:**
- No files matching `**/*test*`, `**/*spec*`
- Watchers system documented but NEVER VERIFIED TO WORK
- merge-json.sh bug indicates no one ever checked the output

### Error Handling: PARTIAL

**Present:**
- Scripts use `set -euo pipefail`
- Justfile commands check for missing files
- merge-json.sh checks for jq availability (line 12)

**Missing:**
- No handling of iCloud Drive permission restrictions
- No validation that merged JSON is correct format
- No checking if launchd watchers actually execute
- No fallback when watchers fail

### Documentation Completeness: POOR

**Coverage:**
- Basic usage: GOOD
- Architecture: GOOD
- API/Commands: POOR (references non-existent features)
- Troubleshooting: MINIMAL
- Testing: MISSING

**Specific Gaps:**
- No mention of iCloud Drive limitations for watchers
- No documentation of actual merge-json.sh behavior vs. claimed behavior
- No guide for validating system actually works
- No explanation of why "install" script is missing despite README claiming it exists

---

## 4. Critical Path Analysis

### Does the Core Functionality Work?

**YES** - Dotbot-based symlink management works correctly:
- `just install-home` successfully creates symlinks
- `just install-work` successfully creates symlinks
- Profile composition correctly overrides global configs
- Symlinks point to correct files in iCloud Drive
- Current system status shows home profile active and correctly configured

**Evidence:**
- Test: `just dry-run-home` shows correct operations
- Test: `just status` shows active profile: HOME with correct symlinks
- Test: `just check-missing` confirms all files are registered
- Actual symlinks verified: ~/.zshrc -> dotfiles-home/zshrc (working)

### Does the Desired Functionality Work?

**PARTIALLY:**

**WORKING:**
- Dotbot installation and profile switching (CORE FEATURE)
- justfile task automation for common operations
- Symlink verification and status checking
- YAML validation
- Manual backup functionality (untested but implemented)

**BROKEN:**
- File watchers system (iCloud permission issues)
- JSON merging functionality (produces wrong output format)
- Installation wrapper script (doesn't exist)
- Several documented justfile commands (don't exist)

**UNTESTED:**
- verify-home/verify-work commands
- backup command
- clean-broken command
- Any watcher functionality end-to-end

### Has the Application Been Run?

**YES** - Core Dotbot functionality has been executed:
- Active home profile confirmed via `just status`
- Symlinks are correctly in place and functional
- User is actively using the home profile configuration

**NO** - Watchers system has NOT been successfully run:
- No active watchers found via `just list-watchers`
- Test execution revealed immediate permission failure
- Output validation reveals merge script doesn't work as documented

### Detected Errors from Execution:

1. **launchd permission error:**
   ```
   /bin/bash: Operation not permitted
   ```
   Location: Attempting to execute `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/dotfiles/scripts/merge-json.sh`

2. **merge-json.sh incorrect output:**
   - Produces: `[{...}, {...}]` (array of objects)
   - Should produce: `{...}` (single merged object)
   - Bug location: Line 19 of merge-json.sh, incorrect jq filter

3. **Missing install script:**
   - Referenced in multiple locations
   - File does not exist
   - Commands like `./install home` will fail with "command not found"

---

## 5. Risk Factors

### 1. Architectural Risks

**iCloud Drive + launchd = INCOMPATIBLE**
- launchd agents cannot execute scripts in iCloud Drive without Full Disk Access
- Watchers system is fundamentally broken on current architecture
- Requires either:
  - Moving repository outside iCloud Drive, OR
  - Copying scripts to non-iCloud location, OR
  - Using alternative to launchd (fswatch, etc.)

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Entire watchers feature is non-functional

### 2. Data Integrity Risks

**merge-json.sh produces wrong output**
- Any use of watchers would corrupt config files
- Users expecting merged JSON would get array of unmerged objects
- No validation catches this error

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Would cause data corruption if used

### 3. Documentation Risks

**Users will attempt to use non-existent features**
- Documentation confidently instructs users to run `./install home`
- Command will fail, causing confusion and loss of trust
- Multiple other phantom commands referenced

**Severity:** HIGH - Undermines user confidence and usability

### 4. Maintenance Risks

**No testing infrastructure**
- Changes cannot be validated
- Bugs like merge-json.sh error go undetected
- No regression detection

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Accumulates technical debt

### 5. Migration Risks

**Old script still functional but deprecated**
- install_dotfiles.sh still works
- Documentation claims it's "removed" but it exists
- Users may be confused about which system to use

**Severity:** LOW - Confusion but not breaking

---

## 6. Detailed Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: Watchers System Non-Functional

**Planned:** (WATCHERS.md)
- Automatic JSON config merging on file change
- launchd-based file watching
- Profile-specific config composition
- Zero-configuration auto-updates

**Actual:**
- Scripts exist and run
- launchd plists are created correctly
- **BUT: Cannot execute due to iCloud permissions**
- **AND: merge-json.sh produces wrong output format**

**Impact:** Entire watchers feature is VAPOR - exists in documentation only

**Fix Required:**
1. Fix jq merge command in merge-json.sh:
   - Change line 19 from: `FILTER="reduce inputs as \$item (.; . * \$item)"`
   - To: `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'` (for 2 files) or `jq -n 'reduce inputs as $item ({}; . * $item)'`
2. Move scripts outside iCloud or use alternative watching mechanism
3. Add validation that merged output is correct format
4. Actually test the system end-to-end

### Gap 2: Missing Installation Wrapper

**Planned:** (README.md line 130, CLAUDE.md line 34, MIGRATION.md lines 86-96)
- Interactive `./install` script
- Takes profile argument: `./install home` or `./install work`
- Wraps Dotbot invocation
- Part of migration from install_dotfiles.sh

**Actual:**
- File does not exist
- Documentation extensively references it
- Users instructed to use it will get "command not found"

**Impact:** Documentation is LYING to users, instructions will fail

**Fix Required:**
1. Either CREATE the install wrapper script, OR
2. UPDATE all documentation to remove references to it
3. Clarify that justfile is the ONLY interface

### Gap 3: Phantom Justfile Commands

**Planned:** (CLAUDE.md, MIGRATION.md)
- `just add-file-home newconfig` - Add file to config
- `just test-home` - Test home profile installation
- `just validate-yaml` - Validate YAML syntax

**Actual:**
- Commands do not exist in justfile
- Some similar commands exist: `validate` (not validate-yaml)
- No file addition helper exists

**Impact:** Documentation is INACCURATE, users cannot follow instructions

**Fix Required:**
1. Either IMPLEMENT these commands, OR
2. REMOVE all references from documentation

### Gap 4: Incorrect Documentation Examples

**Planned:** (WATCHERS.md lines 147-155)
- Shows clean merged JSON object as output example
- Claims "deep merge" functionality
- Provides specific expected output format

**Actual:**
- merge-json.sh produces array of objects
- "Deep merge" does not work as shown
- Examples were never tested

**Impact:** Users will get DIFFERENT OUTPUT than documented, configs will be WRONG FORMAT

**Fix Required:**
1. Fix merge-json.sh script
2. Actually run the examples
3. Update documentation with real tested output

### Gap 5: Zero Test Coverage

**Planned:** (Implied by "best practices" in global CLAUDE.md)
- Testable code
- Solid, useful tests
- Tests before implementation
- Run tests after every change

**Actual:**
- Zero test files
- Zero test infrastructure
- No CI/CD
- Manual testing incomplete

**Impact:** Bugs go undetected, changes are risky, quality is UNKNOWN

**Fix Required:**
1. Create test suite for:
   - Symlink creation/verification
   - Profile switching
   - JSON merging (would have caught current bug!)
   - Watcher functionality
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Establish testing standards

---

## 8. Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (Critical)

1. **FIX merge-json.sh script** - Line 19 produces wrong output
   - Current: `FILTER="reduce inputs as \$item (.; . * \$item)"`
   - Replace with: `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'` or proper reduce filter
   - Test: Verify output is merged object, not array

2. **DOCUMENT iCloud limitations** - Add warning to WATCHERS.md
   - State that watchers cannot work with iCloud-stored repo
   - Provide workaround options
   - Or: Move entire repo outside iCloud

3. **FIX or REMOVE install wrapper references** - Documentation is lying
   - Either: Create the ./install script as documented
   - Or: Remove all references from README.md, CLAUDE.md, MIGRATION.md

### HIGH PRIORITY

4. **Remove phantom command references**
   - Delete references to `just add-file-home` (or implement it)
   - Fix `just test-home` to `just dry-run-home`
   - Fix `just validate-yaml` to `just validate`

5. **Actually test the watchers system**
   - Follow testing instructions in WATCHERS.md
   - Verify merged output is correct
   - Update documentation with real results
   - Or: Remove entire feature if unfixable

6. **Add validation to merge-json.sh**
   - Check output is object, not array
   - Verify jq succeeded
   - Test merged result has expected keys

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

7. **Create basic test suite**
   - Test symlink creation
   - Test profile switching
   - Test JSON merging (would have caught current bug)
   - Test justfile commands

8. **Clarify install_dotfiles.sh status**
   - CLAUDE.md says it's "removed" but file exists and works
   - Either: Actually remove it and document why
   - Or: Update docs to say "deprecated but available"

9. **Add troubleshooting section**
   - Common errors (iCloud permissions, missing jq, broken symlinks)
   - How to verify system is working
   - How to detect when watchers fail

### LOW PRIORITY

10. **Align README with reality**
    - Fix Volta vs fnm discrepancy (line 44)
    - Update file tree to match actual files
    - Remove aspirational features that don't exist

11. **Add CI/CD**
    - GitHub Actions to validate YAML
    - Test merge-json.sh output format
    - Lint shell scripts

---

## 9. Conclusion

This dotfiles repository achieves its CORE MISSION of managing symlinked configuration files across multiple profiles using Dotbot. The justfile provides excellent automation for common tasks, and the profile system works as designed.

However, the repository FAILS to deliver on the WATCHERS feature entirely - it is documented, scripted, but fundamentally broken and untested. The merge-json.sh script produces the wrong output format, and launchd cannot execute scripts in iCloud Drive.

Documentation accuracy is POOR with multiple references to non-existent files and commands. Users following the documentation will encounter failures and confusion.

Testing coverage is ZERO. The merge-json.sh bug and non-functional watchers system prove that features were never actually executed end-to-end.

**Overall Assessment: This project is 65% complete. The core Dotbot functionality works well. The watchers system is vapor. Documentation needs a truth audit.**

**Recommended Action: Either commit to fixing and testing the watchers system, or remove it entirely from documentation and codebase. Do not leave it in this broken, misleading state.**
